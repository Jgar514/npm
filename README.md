# Webslinger CLI Tool

## Overview

The webslinger CLI tool automates the setup of a full-stack website environment, integrates Tailwind CSS for styling, pushes the project to GitHub, and deploys it to Netlifyâ€”all in one streamlined process. It's designed to save developers time by handling tedious setup and deployment tasks.

## Features

- Initializes a Vite-based React project with necessary configurations.
- Integrates Tailwind CSS with default styles and configurations.
- Sets up a basic React component (`App.jsx`) with date and time display.
- Initializes Git repository, creates a new GitHub repository, and makes an initial commit.
- Deploys the project to Netlify, making it instantly accessible via a live URL.
